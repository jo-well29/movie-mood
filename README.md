***Product Vision:***

Movie Mood is a web platform that allows users to find a movie by mood. There are plethora of movie options in our current streaming platforms. The average streaming service subscriber spends 45 minutes browsing and trying to make a decision on what movie to watch. That is half the length of most movies! Movie Mood allows users to take back their time and spend it enjoying a film by recommending a movie based on the mood category searched.

***MVP:***

* Fetch data from [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/4/getting-started/authorization).
* User searches for movies by mood (i.e. happy, mad).
* User is presented with 1 movie that matches the mood.
* Movies are labeled with a mood by using a [text sentiment analysis API](https://rapidapi.com/fyhao/api/text-sentiment-analysis-method/).
