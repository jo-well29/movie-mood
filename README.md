***Product Vision:***

Movie Mood is a web platform that allows users to search for movies by mood. There are plethora of movie options in our current streaming platforms.
The average streaming service subscriber spends 45 minutes browsing and trying to make a decision on what movie to watch.
That is half the length of most movies!
Movie Mood allows users to take back their time and spend it enjoying a film by recommending a movie based on the mood they are looking for.

***MVP:***

* Fetch data from [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/4/getting-started/authorization).
* User searches for movies by mood (i.e. happy, mad).
* User is presented with 1 movie that matches the mood.
* Movies are labeled with a mood by using a text sentinment analysis API.
