# MovieMood

Movie Mood is a web platform that allows users to find a movie aligned with their current mood. There are plethora of movie options in our current streaming platforms. The average streaming service subscriber spends 45 minutes browsing and trying to make a decision on what movie to watch. That is half the length of most movies! Movie Mood allows users to take back their time and spend it enjoying a film by recommending a movie based on the users current mood. Because research shows that mood impacts the way we receive informationâ€“aligning our emotions with the content we are choosing to receive will impact overall user well-being.
